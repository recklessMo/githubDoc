### java的多态

1. 属性找编译，方法找运行？
2. 编译时类型和运行时类型，this指针！

java是静态类型语言，所以编译器尝试在编译的时候就确定变量的类型。

Java is statically typed. That means that every expression (including variables) in the language has a type that is known at compile time according to the rules of the language. This is known as the static type (what you call "compile-time type"). The types in Java are the primitive types and the reference types.
